**OS Hardening with Packer**

# OS Hardening
Reducing available **vectors of attack** by applying best practices in security mitigations on the operating system level.

!SLIDE
# OS Hardening

* Not the only tool in your warchest (application/network hardening)
* Implementation is never finished
* Maintenance is essential.
* Do not just implement: audit ( **openscap** )
  * OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language )
  * SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol)

!SLIDE
# STIG
(Security Technical Implementation Guide)

  * Created by DISA (Defense Informations Agency) as guide for Department of Defense
  * Machine-readable profiles
    * RHEL 7 STIG - SCAP profile ([github.com/OpenSCAP/scap-security-guide](https://github.com/OpenSCAP/scap-security-guide))

!SLIDE
# CIS Benchmarks
(Center of Internet Security)
* Frequently used to meet FISMA, PCI, HIPAA requirements
* Many different benchmarks:
  * Docker Host
  * RHEL 5/6/7
* Machine readable profiles available through paid membership

!SLIDE
# Combine rather than choose

* A lot of similarities between CIS and STIG

!SLIDE
<!-- .slide: data-background="#6B205E" -->
# CIS RHEL 7

!SLIDE
# Example Requirements

* GPG must be used for all yum repositories
* Removal of packages: rsh-server, telnet-server, xorg-x11-server-common
* Disable anything you do not specifically use:
  * **xinetd** (services), **avahi** (zeroconf), **dhcp**, **nfs**
* Ensure NTP is active and properly synchronized

!SLIDE
# You must
<!-- .slide: data-background="#6B205E" -->

!SLIDE
## not have exec rights on /tmp

!SLIDE
### not create world readable files

!SLIDE
### but by far the most annoying is..

!SLIDE
<!-- .slide: data-background="#6B205E" -->
# Multiple mounts

* /var
* /var/log
* /var/log/audit
* /home
* /tmp

!SLIDE
# Rationale

Prevent resource exhaustion.

Allow (audit) logging to continue during application error or attack.

!SLIDE
# cat /dev/zero > zerofile

Check and see how fast you can fill up your disk..

!SLIDE
# Mitigations

* Create multiple virtual filesystems (files) and mount to apply disk quota (RHEL 6)
* If using XFS, use `xfs_quota` to set quota's per project (folder) (XFS is RHEL 7 default root)
* **LVM Logical Volume Manager** (RHEL 6)
  * Span a filesystem over multiple block devices
  * Easy resizing
  * Portability

# Packer: Add LVM to AMI

!SLIDE
# Use the `amazon-chroot` provider

1. Creates volume from AMI snapshot
  * No start of machine required
2. Mounts the Volume to host on AWS
  * Allows direct manipulation of the block device
3. Mounts several `chroot_mounts` (/dev) to
4. Provisioners are started
  * Each provisioner is wrapped by a `chroot` command
5. Unmounts all `chroot_mounts` and detaches volume

!SLIDE
## Challenge

Packer needs to unmount what it had mounted originally
<!-- 2. No way to access {{ .Device }} in provisioner (/dev/xvda1) -->

!SLIDE
# Solution

* Use _shell-local_ provisioner to execute a script on host: _lvm.sh_
  1. Unmount
  2. Backup the device with `tar`
  3. Partition (Boot + LVM)
  4. Create LVM Volume group
    * Create LVM Logical volumes (var,varlog,varlogaudit)
    * Create filesystems
  5. Mount new filesystems
  6. Restore

# Conclusion

Now able to apply filesystems/paritions changes automatically without any reboots.

**Caveats**:

* Create an image hierarchy
* Use amazon-ebs for the child images
  * Has EBS encryption
  * Better support
  * Faster debugging
  * LVM only needs to be added __once__ per source image
